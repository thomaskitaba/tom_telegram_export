[2025-11-04 14:52:20 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: by the way i am trying to create a general list of 
1. what we can do and what we want to do using our model, 
2.  what it should contain  
3. what kind of model it should be
4. where we can find the data source. and what kind of data we should use 
and so on.  i will send you a link so that we can.
5. how it could benefit in decsion making.   and so on ...

[2025-10-30 16:39:56 EAT] @pomiG: Oooh okay alright .... but my accuracy is 48 mnamn percent akebabi thomisha I wish essu zare bayhon
[2025-10-30 16:34:18 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: one last thing: about the last assignment " i dont know if you were in class that time but he said     when you present( or work on the last convoutuion architecture)  try to talk or mention  it predecesor)
[2025-10-30 16:30:35 EAT] @pomiG: Alright sounds fair
[2025-10-30 16:29:52 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: Activation ( if we are allowed since they have presented last time)  —> optimization —> ( convolution types)
[2025-10-30 16:28:52 EAT] @pomiG: Which one do you think we would present in accordance to the time we will have?
[2025-10-30 16:27:32 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: Same here ...
[2025-10-30 16:09:15 EAT] @pomiG: Hbu? How is it going?
[2025-10-30 16:09:07 EAT] @pomiG: I am trying to skim through them fast if he don't ask too many question would be fine i not gn idk

[2025-10-30 11:42:40 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: Thanx.. I thought he only posted slide ... ( last time in class he said you should explain your assignment's any time) so we should prepare for all three.. ) ..
[2025-10-30 11:37:39 EAT] @pomiG: Thomisha he just posted there will be presentation today ... which one will it be?
[2025-10-30 08:29:18 EAT] @pomiG: Yeah faith is one of the elements true
[2025-10-30 08:28:37 EAT] @pomiG: Cool one 😎
[2025-10-29 19:40:40 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: By the way ያቆብ 2:19 says " እግዚአብሔር አንድ እንደ ሆነ አንተ ታምናለህ፤ መልካም ታደርጋለህ፤ አጋንንት ደግሞ ያምናሉ ይንቀጠቀጡማል።  " so  faith alone will make satan Christian.
[2025-10-29 19:29:49 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: 1. ለአንተ እንዲደረግ የምትፈልገውን ለሌሎች አድርግ.     ( this contains part of our last  RNN class especially the last part that says one-to-many,   many-to-many. ..   https://youtu.be/R2ZhLI2-vHI?si=raMm6RSy4VQcr99V)
[2025-10-29 18:15:43 EAT] @pomiG: True that’s a good one … but what do you think makes a Christian Christian though? I mean like the key?
[2025-10-29 17:29:58 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: Not quit but, i guss this is an ordinary thing that any christian should know.. so that they can follow jesus christ even upto death..
[2025-10-29 17:24:09 EAT] @pomiG: Ooh okay i get what you mean now and it’s correct you seem to read a lot about it do you?
[2025-10-29 15:19:50 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: Great..it says " God so loved the world that he gave his only begoten, who ever belives in him shall not be perished but have eternal life... "  but if the question is What does Gods son mean"  instead of what he did .. "     because when jesus asked who do you call me?  "petros said you are the son of God"   beliving is not the problem ..   Knowing what what "Gods only son is" ... because it helps us know our real shepered (ዮሐ 10: በጎቹ እረኛቸውን በድምፁ ያውቁታል).     (and this has been the main thing that created many religions since the 5th century)
[2025-10-29 15:00:00 EAT] @pomiG: Ye egziabher lij malet the one he sacrificed for us the only son he had Jesus yeah?
[2025-10-29 14:57:36 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: great.. It says " ዮሐንስ 20:30- ኢየሱስ የእግዚአብሔር  ልጅ እንደሆነ ታምኑ ዘንድ ወንጌል ተፃፈ"   ...  so the question is ..  የእግዚአብሄር ልጅ ማለት ምንማለት ነው....    because ለማመን ለማመን ሰይጣንም ያምናል ያውም እየተንቀጠቀጠ  (ያቆብ 2:19) 
So " የእግዚአብሔር  ልጅ ነው ስንል ምንድን ነው እያልን ነው "????
[2025-10-29 14:47:36 EAT] @pomiG: Good question .... Believing in Jesus ....
[2025-10-29 14:42:48 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: እውነት ምንድን ነው?
[2025-10-29 14:40:59 EAT] @pomiG: Have lots of it but it’s all defined as truth leza ….
[2025-10-29 14:39:47 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: Yae. But bible has science, politics,  medicen, philosohy ( searching for truth or christ) .. so ..
[2025-10-29 14:37:18 EAT] @pomiG: Took it from the bible it’s not philosophy

1. Write the sum over the product of factors (the BN CPDs)
2. Move all sum inward as far as possible
3. Eliminate a variable by summing it out, creates new factor
4. Repeat until all non-query variables are eliminated

[2025-10-24 22:38:47 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: True... for now just work on it then we we figure out somethi. (by the way it is a group work)
[2025-10-24 22:36:14 EAT] @pomiG: Idk really because tnsh clueless hogne selehone eyeserahu yalehut tnsh bakew tru nbr
[2025-10-24 22:35:20 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: 😂So we are half way there just keep pushing.. do u think u will finish it today..???
[2025-10-24 22:30:13 EAT] @pomiG: That’s good I would say 50% is done and 50% remains 😂

[2025-10-24 22:09:20 EAT] @pomiG: It’s a reminder
[2025-10-24 22:09:17 EAT] @pomiG: Sounds good alright … did you finish your project?
[2025-10-24 22:03:37 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: Why dont we postpone the question thing for tommorrow or for sunday???
[2025-10-24 22:02:17 EAT] @pomiG: Well and alright
[2025-10-24 21:05:03 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: So how are things going ...
[2025-10-24 18:44:21 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: https://youtu.be/w4sJ8SazmFo?si=Ztry-nLxwXXXl_rp

[2025-10-24 17:57:15 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: yes..pommisha
[2025-10-24 17:53:25 EAT] @pomiG: Alright then will check that out prior then … I haven’t read the notes better to read them after grasping the concepts well right?
[2025-10-24 17:37:41 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: Hope so..
[2025-10-24 17:25:29 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: Variable elimination is infrence that follows representation.. all you have to know here is    how to write the joint probablity  given agraph .. (the all we are doing is  find probablity of something using only part of the whole probablity  )
[2025-10-24 17:20:06 EAT] @pomiG: So I can get the concepts from the video?
[2025-10-24 16:54:43 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: Actualy.. there is concept... part but this is a possible question for exam ..  we might also have question to draw junction tree.. (so trust me it is like the d separation we have been doing.. )
[2025-10-24 16:53:15 EAT] @pomiG: Alright then
[2025-10-24 16:48:29 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: I dont think so.. but i will check..
[2025-10-24 16:44:35 EAT] @pomiG: Alright I’ll watch then and also is there anything I should be watching before this
[2025-10-24 16:43:17 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: https://youtu.be/FDNB0A61PGE?si=nlb9oMvsceTsWp1r
[2025-10-24 16:40:42 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: Eshi.. pomishhyaeee ... any ways let me send you the variabke elimination video question..
[2025-10-24 16:39:01 EAT] @pomiG: Alright whatever you say I agree
[2025-10-24 16:30:45 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: Today will be better, dont u think..
[2025-10-24 16:29:42 EAT] @pomiG: When tmr or today?
[2025-10-24 16:29:25 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: So we have time till tommorrow. And we will do questions  (on variable elimination and junction tree)..
[2025-10-24 16:23:57 EAT] @pomiG: I think its tmr
[2025-10-24 16:23:26 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: So.. is today the last submition date.. just to make sure😄
[2025-10-24 16:21:20 EAT] @pomiG: At least i got the dataset the only issue am having now is that finding the best BN structure for it
[2025-10-24 16:19:53 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: 😂.. thanks.. i knew u were going to remember me ... only a little bit left.. hbu..
[2025-10-24 16:17:32 EAT] @pomiG: Is you doing your project?

[2025-10-23 21:55:17 EAT] @pomiG: Idk but I’ll remind any way … I have been having issues with finding the dataset suitable for this PGM been hustling after I went half way through the assignment will need to change my dataset now I think
[2025-10-23 21:53:29 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: why do i keep forgeting about it ???  i will also try to finish it tmr..
[2025-10-23 21:51:33 EAT] @pomiG: Yeah true am trying to do the term project today and tmr to finish it
[2025-10-23 21:46:32 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: yes.  i hope so.. ( we will study it together) — so we have 5 days including Sunday..
[2025-10-23 21:44:09 EAT] @pomiG: You’re a representative eko he knows you asked him because we pushed you … but would be nice if he can just add 2 days to it ewnt
[2025-10-23 21:42:51 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: 🫵 r  right....  ene demo eko.. i was  fine with the ( the exam day)..   but then on the group someone mentioned about extending ( the exam date) then.. i volunteered to ask him ( 🥲even if it was my responsibility ) then this happened 🤣🤣
[2025-10-23 21:36:57 EAT] @pomiG: Ooh btmm nw yasakegn his reply getan 😂 ... aye you tried he might consider and if he don't mnm madreg aychalm
[2025-10-23 21:36:16 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: I guess i took a shot for the group ...     😂 ...  but frankly he might reconsider..
[2025-10-23 21:33:57 EAT] @pomiG: 😂 Wow its "NO" which is very idk but you ask in a very polite way that's really nice
[2025-10-23 21:32:49 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa:  [Photo: photo_2025-10-23_18-32-49.jpg]
[2025-10-23 21:28:55 EAT] @pomiG: Yeah I do think so .... and wait he said no wow he's a bit rigid isn't he?
[2025-10-23 21:28:03 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: i have told him we have exam on saturday.. and asking him to extend his exam for 2 days.. but he said no if we had class he would have said something.. dont you think???
[2025-10-23 21:26:49 EAT] @pomiG: True 😂
[2025-10-23 21:26:35 EAT] @pomiG: Might be on Saturday eyalk nw hoped we didn't have class

[2025-10-23 21:23:43 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: Hope so..  (we will ask Dr beakal to make the presentation after DNN exam) ... Dr Fantahun Said you should always be prepared to explain what you did when you are asked about it ( if you make it then you know it )  so ...
[2025-10-23 21:21:11 EAT] @pomiG: This is really clean thomisha ... when will the presentation be including DL hope we don't have anything on Saturday

[2025-10-23 20:06:44 EAT] @pomiG: I haven’t read about inference should I watch a video now?
[2025-10-23 20:06:26 EAT] @pomiG: Yeah I watched it endelaklgn
[2025-10-23 20:00:09 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: This one

[2025-10-23 18:50:30 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: I called zemzem.. and she said it is better if we all   turnin the assignment.. so that it is easier to give greads..
[2025-10-23 17:50:18 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: my  inernet was out for a while..
[2025-10-23 17:49:39 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: May be we should tell Dr  him.. to submit it with one representative then..  (if the ppt is a must we will create presentation) the internet is out here .....
[2025-10-23 15:02:26 EAT] @pomiG: Btw are we going to submit today's assignment individually or as a group? why does it say upload your ppt?

[2025-10-23 02:06:54 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: Ok.. ( by the way please tell me what are you going to do now)
[2025-10-23 02:06:10 EAT] @pomiG: I don’t think we can do it now there is not light here should have seen this coming 😂

[2025-10-23 01:57:08 EAT] @pomiG: Alright sounds good really
[2025-10-22 22:53:50 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: Pommisha if you have time now: we can do questions of the video..
[2025-10-22 21:24:17 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: Yemir.. we will get through it together ...  i am trying to read dr beakals new slides i found new things there.. i am taking notes  down as important points which we will discuss together ......
[2025-10-22 21:13:10 EAT] @pomiG: Alright this is a brief plan tsede nw btmm
[2025-10-22 20:58:57 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: so from my perspective the question content are 
( the whole content is going to be        probablity—->representation—>infrence—->learning)
1. Probablity ( like the ones we did yesterday) ——-—-probablity
2. D-separation in Baysian Network ( which we were doing yesterday)——-Representation
3. Baysian and Marcove concepts ( which we will study together)——Representation
4. infrence algorithm ( concept   and algorithm)   —- we will do questions variable elimination——Infrence
5. Learning:  concept——Learning
[2025-10-22 20:49:35 EAT] @pomiG: Wowww good to know where it focuses more … we can focus more on the specifics
[2025-10-22 20:42:21 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: by the way this was the test content for regulars "Conditional probability question

Marginal likelihood or probability question with bayeesian probability 

Bayesian network concepts 

Markov network concepts theory part 

Conditiaonl independence in both bayesian and Markov networks (i.e.d separation algorithm in Bayesian)


Variable elimination algorithm"
[2025-10-22 20:41:58 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: True.. but even if he wont.. do.t worry we will get it handled....
By the way we should read the concepts too.. (i am trying to take note here so we will see them together....)
[2025-10-22 20:36:36 EAT] @pomiG: If only he would agree would be great
[2025-10-22 20:30:28 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: By the way i have sent message to. Dr Fantahun asking him if he can make it on saturday...
[2025-10-22 20:28:50 EAT] @pomiG: Ooh okay … 😂 been forever true
[2025-10-22 20:25:23 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: I left home just before the ...  " we will talk about it part" .. it has been like forever since i heard from u😂
[2025-10-22 20:22:34 EAT] @pomiG: Where you outside?
[2025-10-22 19:09:52 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: I am home now ....

[2025-10-22 16:26:30 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: We will talk about it
[2025-10-22 16:15:13 EAT] @pomiG: Would love that too … one thing I find hard is not knowing where to start studying
[2025-10-22 16:07:03 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: 😄. i havent tried it that much..😄 but for sure i will use it..  ( by Then i will send you Videos for DNN too)
[2025-10-22 15:56:15 EAT] @pomiG: It’s cool right especially if you give it a single thing you don’t understand for it to describe it in a way you can … 👌
[2025-10-22 15:55:38 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: By the way i tried.. poe.com   it has lots of things in there
[2025-10-22 15:54:02 EAT] @pomiG: God help us we will try
[2025-10-22 15:53:40 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: Yes.. but dont worry ... we will try our best..
[2025-10-22 15:52:02 EAT] @pomiG: DNN is a lot too eko a conceptually
[2025-10-22 15:51:49 EAT] @pomiG: Alright I think that’s a better plan …
[2025-10-22 15:51:13 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: You are right.. unless we stick to our plan... let us study as if it is on saturday... ( I guess we should start studying DNN to)
[2025-10-22 15:48:35 EAT] @pomiG: Era Thomisha it was better if it were for Saturday eko ahun yiderebibinal
[2025-10-22 15:47:57 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: Dnn is on october 30.. Thursday
[2025-10-22 15:46:50 EAT] @pomiG: You have got to be kidding me really? And how about DNN
[2025-10-22 15:45:50 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: We will do it together..(i have seen it too.. it is a little bit confussing tho).. dont forget the important term section.. om the note (litreally those are the concepts the regulars said the exam was all about)...   and just now while i was writing this zemzem called and said PGM exam post poned to tuesday 12:00 lt
[2025-10-22 15:37:20 EAT] @pomiG: Thomisha i get it but at the same time too confused at some points
[2025-10-22 14:20:14 EAT] @pomiG: Eshi

[2025-10-20 22:59:48 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: Awsome. ( tommorrow we will do some excercise about probablity ..  the next day questions on representation ... then read about infrence algorithms ......  finally about learning (i guess learning has little content)
[2025-10-20 22:56:34 EAT] @pomiG: But i can make time for work in the morning and study on the afternoon session and as for the project use the night time
[2025-10-20 22:56:07 EAT] @pomiG: I can do it at my work place am a bit stressed because we're supposed to do 2 works bande then also i have work 😂

[2025-10-20 22:28:22 EAT] @pomiG: Okay I’ll be using it then … I think we should have a time based plan to achieve both studying and the project
[2025-10-20 22:26:11 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: ok
[2025-10-20 22:24:28 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: Ok.... by the way this is the site i told u about  making presentation gamma.app

[2025-10-20 22:20:17 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: Here is our Group Project [File: Infrence in PGM (1).docx]
[2025-10-20 22:18:49 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: which project plan?? by the way i forgot about the term project..  and i remembered about it yesterday when you mention it.. 😄
[2025-10-20 22:17:29 EAT] @pomiG: Okay sounds good and the hours too … how about the project plan
[2025-10-20 22:16:30 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: we have to have a plan....   
this is how the chapters are divided
1. Probablity  - 1 day  tuesday     oct 21
2. representaion - 1 day  wednesday   oct 22
3. infrecenc - 1 day  thursday ———- oct 23   ( we have 2 days for the term project) 
4. learning - 1 day  Friday

so i guess we have time..
[2025-10-20 22:11:59 EAT] @pomiG: Do you think this all can be achieved in the days we have the project and the study
[2025-10-20 22:10:29 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: I havent finished it yet.. i have the code but i have to do the implementation document... ( by the way Pommisha.. we should read the concepts)  that was what he said on our first class. this is what he said "we want you to know these 3 concepts representaion->infrecenc->learning"
[2025-10-20 22:07:33 EAT] @pomiG: Am worried about the term project
[2025-10-20 22:07:26 EAT] @pomiG: Alright that sounds good glad we have something done before the day 😂
[2025-10-20 22:06:17 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: Great... so in the mean time.... PGM group project is completed.. i will send you the docx.. so that you can check it for errors, mistakes or... (mohamed is going to send his code today or now) that way we are all done...

[2025-10-20 10:48:02 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: Start from the basic probablity.. surafel said there are probablity questions..

https://youtu.be/94AmzeR9n2w
[2025-10-20 10:41:13 EAT] @pomiG: Eshi lets do that then
[2025-10-20 10:39:49 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: A week a go "previous class lectures were uploaded" the ones he used to teach in class (so we have duplucates in there)  ... i havent read the add ones yet.. but i belive they are simpler versions of the orignal slides. let us start from probablity
[2025-10-20 10:33:02 EAT] @pomiG: which ones are they its like 10 ppt in total post yaderegew
[2025-10-20 10:31:34 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: dr beakal has attached.. previous class lectures which are not complicated (i will look on to that today).. i belive we should look at the pdfs.
[2025-10-20 10:29:00 EAT] @pomiG: Ayeee 😂 yihun I'll watch them now tho are they enough for the first few chapters the videos? or checking the ppt is mandatory?
[2025-10-20 10:28:07 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: Noooo you were busy... i even forgot i posted it here.. የኔ ልባም
[2025-10-20 10:26:30 EAT] @pomiG: And i haven't watched yet i have issue don't i 😞

[2025-10-20 10:21:56 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: Which project.. pommisha.
[2025-10-20 10:20:18 EAT] @pomiG: Alright would love that send me the links to the videos please am trying to study while starting the project along side and am confused
[2025-10-20 10:17:28 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: Ok will.. so we will do it together
1. start from probablity 
Addition rule--> multiplication rule(joint pribablity) --> bays theorem (by the was for sure 48%😁 there will be question about it),  chain rule, ( i will send u video and question.)--> total probablity
2. Representation
Types of graph ( baysian and marcove) -->
the 3 Canons of bays theory( this is a very very must to understand everythig .. we wilm have questions from here too )

----- there are other things to -- 

3. infrence.  (like the ones on the project)

4. leaning (.. about to read)
[2025-10-20 10:05:55 EAT] @pomiG: Btw I really don't know where to start please send me a video to start the study like starting from chapter one
[2025-10-20 10:05:25 EAT] @pomiG: Thomisha what's up
[2025-10-20 09:59:58 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: Good morning to you too..

[2025-10-19 20:28:07 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: only mine and mohamed part left.
[2025-10-19 20:23:56 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: then i will send it to you.. so that you can check it for errors or ..
[2025-10-19 20:23:35 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: great, let me just put every thing together.
[2025-10-19 20:14:05 EAT] @pomiG: Blwww 😂 okay I feel overwhelmed now … yichalal keeping the titles only is enough
[2025-10-19 20:08:07 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: ውይ: አንጀት አርስ እኮ ነሽ.. by the way what if we remove the other contents and keep only the code for the jupyter note book... just like this..

https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tF2dIc4FQCvFKksz9g-yoSz0x8Rd1le2?usp=sharing  ( this way we will both query and code)
[2025-10-19 19:54:47 EAT] @pomiG: Anything you need help with thomisha
[2025-10-19 19:48:13 EAT] @pomiG: Yihew tomishayeee [File: PGM_Group.docx]
[2025-10-19 19:21:41 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: pommisha, how is everything there??
[2025-10-19 18:22:39 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: Alright. Pommisha..
[2025-10-19 18:21:43 EAT] @pomiG: Alright I’ll send you the structured one for the pdf one then
[2025-10-19 18:20:20 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: Love the code part.  So we will add our codes on yours.
So we will have a pdf and jupyter note book version. 

1. The pdf currently the docx. 
You can structure it like the others

2. The jupyter notebook (we will add  our codes to it:  meaning we will have only code file that contains our code)
[2025-10-19 18:13:54 EAT] @pomiG: Alright do you want me to send you the docx version or I can structure it like yenesu if necessary
[2025-10-19 17:53:39 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: Pommisha.. i think we can just upload yours as it is. While keeping the content on the docx as it is (i guess it has sufficent content)
[2025-10-19 17:50:40 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: Yae. .. oh it has code.  So we will upload it as it is. Saying we have code for sum product bp.  love it .. 

- what if we take the none code part and add it to our docx file ---> then we will upload the code part saying  real word application.  Or example.. 

Let me send you the current status of our docx    kereyus.. zeharas part is added ..  
[2025-10-19 17:50:36 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa:  [File: infrence_pgm.docx]
[2025-10-19 17:39:44 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: Ok..
[2025-10-19 17:34:38 EAT] @pomiG: Yeah I can do that too but see it first of there is anything that needs editing or removing
[2025-10-19 17:24:00 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: pomissha  can u semd me docx verzsion.. because we are going to submit pdf..

[2025-10-18 23:03:28 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: The projects core idea is to be happy... to have fun.. to have manythings we need (assuming we are good with what we dont have😁) ...    i guess this should be our priority ( by z way i am not kidding about the peoject)
[2025-10-18 22:49:30 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: By the way let me tell u what the new  idea is for our project is.

[2025-09-30 23:58:31 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: 👍
[2025-09-30 23:54:31 EAT] @pomiG: Yeah for sure we wouldn’t be stressed
[2025-09-30 23:47:48 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: That actually is a great idea, it would have been much better if one of it could have been pushed further..
[2025-09-30 23:42:01 EAT] @pomiG: If it’s both would be Monday would be nice
[2025-09-30 23:34:25 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: Yes u are right.. so we might as well prepare for it.   I have been sending him msgs but he was not answering may be  i will tell him for us to make it after monday next week.
[2025-09-30 23:30:00 EAT] @pomiG: Yeah that’s how it should work logically but you never know what the teacher thinks though or he might actually even want us to do it  both together
[2025-09-30 23:25:04 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: Logically: the first assignment (activation function) should be presented first.. then the second (optimization algorithms) because   even on  the course   activation functions (forward propagation) comes before optimizations(on backward propagation).    So we are going to prezent assignment one.. dont u think?..
[2025-09-30 23:17:37 EAT] @pomiG: That’s why it would help if we knew which assignment we will be presenting
[2025-09-30 23:17:22 EAT] @pomiG: To be fair I didn’t do much had too much work semonun … so I’ll have to do it all day tmr
[2025-09-30 23:11:47 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: How is DNN presentation going on.. (i have read about it.. and now all i have to do is compile the slide)

Dr natnael told us about this AI movie Titled "Her"   .. it is about a man who falls in Love with his AI operating system.. (i watched it.. i wanted to share the video link on the group but for some reason i didnt)   🙏 watch it specially as AI Msc Student..  that is my recomendation.
[2025-09-30 22:53:39 EAT] @pomiG: True 😂 … wooo I don’t really have any recommendation today btw so sorry … for sure
[2025-09-30 22:50:34 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: Yaaee behind every .. there should be a .. .  By the way today.. i have no work so any movie recomendation  on netflix.. (we will one day neflix an chill😂😂)
[2025-09-30 22:45:29 EAT] @pomiG: Cool plan really 😂 … as a student we like it and we support it
[2025-09-30 22:40:20 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: So here is my plane. 

1. Let us here what the teachers and coordinator have to say about the end date. Tommorow .. 

if they respond: 
   we will try to make it .. to  1 month 
If they dont
    we will try to make it .. to  1 mnt  😂
2. Repeat task 1 until convergence 

(by the way i felt like being geeky 🤣)
[2025-09-30 22:27:05 EAT] @pomiG: That’s the best idea … for sure
[2025-09-30 22:20:09 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: pommisha... We have to talk about it on the group.... so that we can all decide on a class end date that best suits our need..  dont u think?
[2025-09-30 22:02:19 EAT] @pomiG: Ask Fev she was in the class endeza sil
[2025-09-30 22:02:10 EAT] @pomiG: Am hoping for that too a month would be fair for finals and term projects and also we didn’t finish the course outline eko
[2025-09-30 22:00:57 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: Frankly i dont remember.. but at least we started DNN 2 or 3 weeks ago, so we should ask for appropriate time.. (how long does it take for a summer course? if 2 then we should have at least a month left for it) -------
[2025-09-30 21:54:42 EAT] @pomiG: You mean we can get more time nw? … and also Idk if you remember but Dr.Beakal said this semester won’t end unless we finish the whole modules of the course … even if they force us to do so … blo nbr
[2025-09-30 21:52:39 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: Yes.   
That would be great (what they said is we might have to even after the class ends... where there is no school)   we can calculate it based on the remaining slides???
[2025-09-30 21:48:59 EAT] @pomiG: Would a month be too much to ask for to finalize this semester?
[2025-09-30 21:48:46 EAT] @pomiG: Yeah the registration wouldn’t be a problem but at least they need to give us time for the exam and term projects right?
[2025-09-30 21:45:50 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: = Dr seleshi called 2 hrs ago and said, what i posted on the group, 
= so for sure we have to know when class ends for this semister. 
= i think they wanted us to quarl on the group about it.
[2025-09-30 21:34:24 EAT] @pomiG: Ooh wow the hell are they thinking … does that mean this semester will be done btmm soon or they just want us to register and pay for the next one now nw?
[2025-09-30 20:48:15 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: Look for the Group message, something is about to go up or down..

[2025-09-09 09:49:08 EAT] @pomiG: Okay sounds legit .... you think its a good idea to search or ask a professional on the area like doctors if they would have a clue I can ask
[2025-09-09 09:33:17 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: In accordance .... If we want we could find publication about ethiipia prussing health issue it would have been great.. 
so we have to aswer this questions

1. What problems are not solved due complexity
2. What is the pressing health issue that needs imidiate attention

So how can we answer these questions?
[2025-09-09 09:25:29 EAT] @pomiG: Woww these are really cool ideas ... should we choose based of off the complexity or in accordance to this country need?
[2025-09-08 23:52:29 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: This are some of the problems which we can solve.

[2025-09-03 23:16:08 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: Why don't we list all the possible medicen related ( or agri.. if we chose it)...
models that can be done for developing countries... so we can get our hands on some experience on real world problem...
[2025-09-03 22:59:16 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: i used notebook lm       to read part of it.....    what do you think i am  50 / 50.. the status quo ... will matter.. what about medicen.. but we will discuss on it..
[2025-09-03 22:56:39 EAT] @pomiG: Okay we can do that … seems like it have lots of contents to choose from so should we focus on the medical or agricultural part?
[2025-09-03 22:50:38 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: Ok, we will figure out a way to do it.. we will start by selecting a problem.. we should do some research on it..  by the way we can get idea on what to do from the digital ethiopia 2020- 2030 doc ( i guess there are 4 major areas     health, agriculture, manufacureing, and IT)..

[2025-09-03 22:19:12 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: thank,,, they said to implement it you have to learn some courses until the end of next year.... that is why they require us to be working on our thesis...
[2025-09-03 22:18:36 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: yep, but next time i am thinking of something related to medicen...
[2025-09-03 22:02:28 EAT] @pomiG: Wow this is really cool and very much so applicable

[2025-09-03 21:30:11 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: Oh .. you are right .. you should be doing your thesis to be eligible for the masters scholar.    

they told me this When i was on the interview.. but they said.. to have more chance next time bring a  tangable thing to show as.. (it is not a must)..
[2025-09-03 21:24:11 EAT] @pomiG: Oooh okay i get it that’s a valid idea is it individual or group plus heard that you can only do your PHD if you do thesis not project not sure if it applies for us too tho
[2025-09-03 21:22:07 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: Yes, but to have more chance of being selected, they said " to  ha a  do a tangable project on specfic area of your choice". so we have to try and solve problem related to healt and agriculture..

[2025-08-30 20:24:06 EAT] @pomiG: Alright
[2025-08-30 20:23:24 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: Let me read it..
[2025-08-30 20:21:58 EAT] @pomiG: Thomishayeee I just compared yours with mine straight up and this is the suggestion it gave me the first indicates your code and the errors it shows mnamn 

After analyzing both implementations, I can identify several **critical problems** with the **first implementation** compared to the **second implementation**:

## Major Problems with the First Implementation:

### 1. **Structural Design Flaws**
- **Incorrect causal relationships**: The first implementation has medically unrealistic dependencies:
  - `HasRespiratoryProblems` depends on `HasHayFever` (illogical)
  - `Vomits` depends on `HasPneumonia` (medically incorrect)
  - `HasFever` depends only on `HasRespiratoryProblems` (missing key causes)

- **Second implementation** has proper medical causality:
  - Respiratory problems → Coughs (correct)
  - Gastric problems → Vomits (correct)
  - Multiple causes → Fever (realistic)

### 2. **Accuracy Issues**
- **First implementation**: L1 Distance = 0.318152, KL Divergence = 0.194934
- **Second implementation**: L1 Distance = 0.001782, KL Divergence = 0.000005

**The second implementation is 178x more accurate** in L1 distance!

### 3. **Query Performance Problems**
- **First implementation shows major query errors**:
  - `P(HasFlu | HasFever=true, Coughs=true)`: Error of 0.425329 (completely wrong)
  - `P(Vomits | HasPneumonia=true)`: Error of 0.555492 (dramatically wrong)

- **Second implementation**: All queries have errors < 0.0006 (highly accurate)

### 4. **Implementation Quality Issues**
- **First implementation**:
  - Manual, non-vectorized code
  - No proper error handling
  - Basic output formatting
  - Missing visualization and analysis

- **Second implementation**:
  - Vectorized operations for efficiency
  - Professional error handling
  - Comprehensive visualization suite
  - Detailed medical insights

### 5. **Medical Realism Problems**
- **First implementation** has biologically implausible relationships:
  - Hay fever causing respiratory problems (incorrect)
  - Pneumonia causing vomiting (medically unsound)
  - Missing fever causes (flu, pneumonia should cause fever)

- **Second implementation** captures realistic medical pathways

## Critical Errors in First Implementation:

1. **`Vomits` incorrectly depends on `HasPneumonia`** - This is medically nonsense
2. **`HasFever` missing key dependencies** - Should depend on flu and pneumonia directly
3. **`HasRespiratoryProblems` incorrectly depends on `HasHayFever`** - Hay fever doesn't cause respiratory problems
4. **Poor parameter estimation** - Results in dramatically inaccurate queries

## Recommendation:

**The second implementation is vastly superior** and should be used. The first implementation has fundamental flaws in:

1. **Medical accuracy** (incorrect causal relationships)
2. **Statistical accuracy** (poor parameter estimation)
3. **Implementation quality** (basic vs professional code)
4. **Query reliability** (major errors in diagnostic results)

The second implementation's accuracy (KL=0.000005 vs 0.194934) demonstrates it properly captures the true joint distribution, while the first implementation fails to model the medical domain correctly.

[2025-07-25 23:07:58 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: this field has no comptition yet,  only a handfull of graduates (with msc in ai) we should take it siriously.   We can even create a group on telegram to teach one another that way we all will be forced to push hard...
[2025-07-25 23:03:26 EAT] @pomiG: Oooh wow you think 😂 ... I wish i be that ewnt ... am afraid of making it through this semester btw Idk what I can do if i don't

[2025-07-25 22:44:20 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: BY THE WAY 4 has lots of concepts..
[2025-07-25 22:44:12 EAT] @pomiG: That's the main thing then won't be concerned
[2025-07-25 22:43:09 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: 😂..... dont worry It is readable separetly...

[2025-07-25 22:38:55 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: 4 learning robots—> 5 HRI —> 6 Autonomous systems
[2025-07-25 22:36:30 EAT] @pomiG: How is the procedure of the chapters I don’t get it after 3
[2025-07-25 22:36:15 EAT] @pomiG: Ooh so he might not bring it up now
[2025-07-25 22:35:26 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: the algorithm was related to RRT ( if i am remembering correctly)
[2025-07-25 22:34:36 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: oops i mean lectur 4. slide   learning robots...
[2025-07-25 22:34:31 EAT] @pomiG: What algorithm were we asked from chapter 3 on Mid?
[2025-07-25 22:33:38 EAT] @pomiG: Okay there is a few for PRM and RRT on chapter 3 I guess
[2025-07-25 22:33:24 EAT] @pomiG: Oooh wow how is this on Chapter 1 didn’t notice at all

[2025-07-25 22:31:08 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa:  [Photo: photo_2025-07-25_19-31-08.jpg]
[2025-07-25 22:30:57 EAT] @thomas_kitaba_feyissa: Just a guess:  since we had algorithm on the mid from chapter 3.  I guess the algorithm may be from chaptet 4 onwards but it is a geniun guess..   i saw this  reinforcement learning algorithm on chapter 1..
[2025-07-25 22:23:58 EAT] @pomiG: Motion planning could have many questions probably … what kind of questions you think he’s going to bring up like algorithms or just concepts to write about?
[2025-07-25 22:23:27 EAT] @pomiG: Ooh you know what I did I read starting from the first chapter until the 4th about to continue with the 5th and 6th one

[2025-06-25 20:10:21 EAT] @pomiG: * **You Don't Have to Say How Many Groups at the Start:** One cool thing is that you don't need to know how many groups you want right away. You can let the algorithm build the whole hierarchy and then decide later how many groups make sense by looking at the dendrogram.
* **How We Measure "Closeness" Matters:** There are different ways to decide how close two groups are. We could say two groups are close if their nearest members are close (single linkage), or if their furthest members are close (complete linkage), or something in between like looking at the average distance between all members (average linkage). The way we measure this "closeness" really affects the final groups we get.
* **Can Be Slow for Big Groups:** For very large numbers of friends, figuring out the distances between all the groups and doing the merges can take a lot of time.
* **Once Merged, That's It:** Once two groups get merged, they stay together forever in the process. You can't undo a merge..
[2025-06-25 20:10:21 EAT] @pomiG: Clustering with K-Means: Finding Our Group's Center

Imagine you've got a bunch of friends scattered around, and you want to divide them into a few groups. With K-Means, it's like deciding on a number of meeting points (that's what the "K" is for). The algorithm then works in rounds to figure out the best spots for these meeting points and who should belong to which group.

Here's the breakdown:

* **Picking the Meeting Points (K):** First, you decide how many groups you want. Let's say you pick 3. The algorithm will then start by randomly picking 3 initial meeting points. Think of it like just guessing some good central locations to begin with.

* **Assigning Friends to Meeting Points:** In each round, every friend looks at all the meeting points and decides to join the one that's closest to them.

* **Finding the Real Center:** Once everyone has chosen a meeting point, for each group, we figure out the actual central location based on where all the friends in that group are now. This becomes the new, improved meeting point for the next round.

* **Repeating Until Things Settle:** We keep repeating the "assigning" and "finding the center" steps until the groups of friends don't change anymore, or the meeting points stop moving around much. At that point, we've found our clusters!

**Things to Keep in Mind About K-Means:**

* **You Have to Guess the Number of Groups:** One tricky part is that you have to tell K-Means how many groups you're expecting beforehand. Sometimes it's obvious, but other times you might need to try a few different numbers to see what makes the most sense.
* **Starting Points Matter:** The initial guesses for the meeting points can actually affect the final groups you end up with. Sometimes, starting with slightly different guesses can lead to better results, so it's often a good idea to run the algorithm a few times and pick the best outcome.
* **Best for Roundish Groups:** K-Means works best when your groups are kind of circular or blob-shaped and roughly the same size. If you have groups that are very long and winding, or very different in size, K-Means might not do the best job.
* **Everyone Gets Grouped:** K-Means always puts every single friend into one of the groups. It doesn't have a way of saying someone doesn't really belong to any group.
* **Distance is Key:** The algorithm uses distance to decide who belongs to which group. Usually, it's just straight-line distance, but you could use other ways to measure how "far apart" your friends are.

**Clustering with Agglomerative (Hierarchical): Building Groups Step-by-Step**

Now, let's think about another way to group our friends. Agglomerative clustering is like starting with everyone as their own tiny group and then slowly merging the closest groups together until we have the number of groups we want, or even just one big group of everyone! It builds a sort of family tree of groups.

Here's how it works:

* **Everyone Starts Alone:** Imagine each friend is their own individual group to begin with.

* **Finding the Closest Pairs:** The algorithm looks at all the groups and finds the two groups that are the most similar or "closest" to each other.

* **Merging the Closest:** It then takes those two closest groups and merges them into one bigger group.

* **Repeating the Process:** We keep repeating the "find the closest and merge" steps. In each step, the number of groups goes down by one.

* **Creating a Family Tree (Dendrogram):** As we merge groups, we can draw a diagram called a dendrogram. It looks like a tree, and it shows how the groups got merged together. The height of the branches tells you how "far apart" the groups were when they got merged.

* **Deciding on the Final Groups:** We can stop this process whenever we want. For example, we might decide we want a specific number of final groups. We can then look at our "family tree" and see where to "cut" it to get that many groups.

**Things to Keep in Mind About Agglomerative Clustering:**

[2025-06-25 15:38:56 EAT] @pomiG: Clustering with DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)

DBSCAN is a density-based clustering algorithm that groups together closely packed data points, marking as outliers points that lie alone in low-density regions. Unlike centroid-based clustering algorithms like K-Means, DBSCAN doesn't require specifying the number of clusters beforehand and can discover clusters of arbitrary shapes.

Two key parameters define DBSCAN:

Epsilon (ε or eps): This parameter specifies the radius within which to search for neighboring points around a given point.
MinPts: This parameter specifies the minimum number of points required within the ε-neighborhood of a point to consider that point a core point.

DBSCAN Algorithm Flow:

1.  **Initialization:** Start with an arbitrary unvisited data point.

2.  **Core Point Identification:** For each point in the dataset:
    * Count the number of points within its ε-neighborhood (including the point itself).
    * If the count is greater than or equal to `MinPts`, the point is labeled as a **core point**.

3.  **Cluster Formation:**
    * If a point is a core point and has not yet been assigned to a cluster, a new cluster is formed.
    * All points within the ε-neighborhood of this core point are added to the new cluster.
    * The algorithm then iteratively visits all the points in this new cluster and finds their ε-neighbors. If any of these neighbors are also core points (and not yet assigned to a cluster), their ε-neighbors are also added to the current cluster. This process continues until no more core points are reachable within the cluster.

4.  **Border Point Identification:**
    * Points that are not core points but fall within the ε-neighborhood of a core point are labeled as **border points**. These points are assigned to the cluster of the neighboring core point.
    * A border point can be within the ε-neighborhood of multiple core points but will be assigned to only one cluster based on the order in which the core points are processed.

5.  **Outlier Identification:**
    * Points that are neither core points nor border points are labeled as **noise** or **outliers**. These points do not belong to any cluster.

6.  **Iteration:** The algorithm repeats steps 1-5 until all data points have been visited and classified as either belonging to a cluster (as a core or border point) or as an outlier.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Sequential Cluster Formation:** Clusters are indeed formed sequentially. As you noted, if a non-core point is within the ε-neighborhood of core points belonging to different clusters that are formed at different times, it will be assigned to the first cluster it encounters during the algorithm's progression. It cannot belong to multiple clusters.
* **Non-Core Point Role:** Non-core points (border points) can only join a cluster if they are within the ε-neighborhood of a core point. They cannot be used to extend a cluster further by attracting other points to their neighborhood. Only core points have the ability to expand the cluster by including other core points within their ε-neighborhood.
* **Parameter Sensitivity:** The choice of ε and `MinPts` significantly impacts the clustering results. You may need to experiment with different values to find the parameters that best suit your data. A larger ε will result in more points being included in a cluster, potentially merging clusters. A higher `MinPts` will require denser regions to form clusters, potentially leading to more points being classified as outliers.
