        "*   The Kaggle datasets (`games.csv`, `games_details.csv`, `players.csv`) were successfully loaded and merged to create a base DataFrame containing game and player details.\n",
        "*   A method to simulate lineup data by grouping players with the same minutes played within a game and team was implemented, focusing on 5-player groups. The turnover column name required correction from 'TOV' to 'TO' during aggregation.\n",
        "*   The initial cleaning and filtering of the Kaggle lineup data resulted in a DataFrame with 11 rows after filtering for lineups with more than 20 minutes played. No missing values were found in critical columns in this filtered subset.\n",
        "*   The initial \"smart\" discretization strategy applied to the Kaggle data resulted in the 'Efficiency' variable having only a single category ('Medium'), rendering subsequent Bayesian network learning and inference for 'Efficiency' states other than 'Medium' impossible.\n",
        "*   A revised, simpler discretization strategy using basic binning was implemented to address the small dataset size and limited unique values. This successfully created multiple categories (2 or 3) for all variables except 'Efficiency', which remained a single category ('Medium') due to the input data.\n",
        "*   The Bayesian Network structure was adapted to the available discretized variables from the Kaggle data, and CPTs were learned successfully using the Maximum Likelihood Estimator.\n",
        "*   Inference and validation tests were successfully adapted and run on the Kaggle-based Bayesian Network. However, the results confirmed that meaningful inference regarding 'High' or 'Low' efficiency was not possible due to the single state present in the 'Efficiency' node of the learned model.\n",

        "*   The current Kaggle dataset and the simple discretization strategy employed yield a \"flat\" Bayesian Network where 'Efficiency' is a constant. To build a functional predictive or analytical model for different levels of 'Efficiency', either a dataset with more variability in the relevant statistics (especially plus-minus) is needed, or a more sophisticated discretization method that can create multiple categories from limited data points (if statistically justifiable).\n",
        "*   Explore alternative methods for simulating lineups from the Kaggle data, as grouping solely by exact minutes played might not capture all on-court combinations and could limit the dataset size. Consider approaches based on substitution patterns or sequential analysis if feasible with the available data timestamps.\n"
